      Shaun Inman makes an interesting proposal for adding "qualified"
      (or parent) selectors to the CSS spec.  Pay attention to the discussion,

    * `https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Writing_Efficient_CSS`  
      From 2000, a post by Dave Hyatt on browser performance in regard to CSS
      rule definitions.  Talks about matches starting with the rightmost
      selector.  The article is specifically about "Mozilla UI", but probably
      relevant to Mozilla in general and, now that Dave is at Apple, Safari too.
